# Covid_19 Spatial Analysis 

## Studies  
### :one: Spatial analysis of the indices related to the spread and vaccination against Covid-19: Spatial Clustering Behaviour of Covid-19 Conditioned by the Development Level: Case Study for the Administrative Units in Romania  
"Spatial analyses related to Covid-19 have been so far conducted at county, regional or national level, without a thorough assessment at the continuous local level of administrative-territorial units like cities, towns, or communes. To address this gap, we employ daily data on the infection rate provided for Romanian administrative units from March to May 2021. Using the global and local Moran I spatial autocorrelation coefficients, we identify significant clustering processes in the Covid-19 infection rate. Additional analysis based on spatially smoothed rate maps and spatial regressions prove that this clustering pattern is influenced by the development level of localities, proxied by unemployment rate and Local Human Development Index. Results show the features of the 3rd wave in Romania, characterized by a quadratic trend."

### :two: Exploring the Spatial Clustering and Spillover Effects of COVID-19 Vaccination Uptake in Romania: An Analysis at Municipality Level  
"This article examines the effects of the Covid-19 crisis on the banking sector of Romania using a spatial panel dataset of 21 months, from April 2020 to December 2021, among 41 counties. The empirical setup exploits the spatial and time-series variations of the banking sector during the pandemic via means of exploratory data analysis, simple linear models for each month with spatial diagnosis, and spatial panel data models with fixed effects. County-level differences and particular disturbances in the trend of banking services are highlighted against the turning points of the pandemic. We show that increasing Covid-19 infections result in higher loans and savings per capita, with significant spatial interactions given by the neighboring counties."  

### :three: Evaluation of the space-time effects of Covid-19 on household loans and savings in Romania-A spatial panel data approach at county level
